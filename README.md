# Squeegee

_A PowerShell script by Ben Kennish (ben@kennish.net)_

What's the best way to clean Windows?  With a Squeegee! ðŸ§½ðŸ’¦   ðŸ˜œ

The script simply runs a lot of maintenance tasks to help ensure Windows (10/11) is running well and frees up disk space.

## DISCLAIMER

The tools the script uses are system tools designed for proper system stuff.  Squeegee _shouldn't_ break your computer but if it does, don't come crying to me (i.e. I accept no liability for any damage caused, etc etc).
