# Squeegee

A PowerShell script by Ben Kennish (ben@kennish.net)

What's the best way to clean Windows?  With a Squeegee! ðŸ§½ðŸ’¦ ðŸ˜œ
Simply runs a lot of maintenance tasks to help ensure Windows (10/11) is running well and to free up disk space.

# DISCLAIMER

The tools the script uses are system tools designed for proper system stuff.  Squeegee shouldn't break your computer but if it does, don't come crying to me (i.e. I accept no liability for any damage caused).
